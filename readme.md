## EJS practice:

### Challenge 1:
Create an object that describes you and display that in the index ejs file.

### Challenge 2:
Using the array provided display a list of all the users in the list ejs file.

### Challenge 3:
Using the login ejs file, Allow the user to type in their name and when they submit it should update the ejs file to contain the users name. Do this with the storage.json file. (There's no need to store multiple users, just the last one that entered a name).
